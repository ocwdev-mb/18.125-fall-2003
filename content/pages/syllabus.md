## Description

This course will be an introduction to abstract measure theory and the Lebesgue integral. We will begin by defining the Lebesgue integral, prove the main convergence theorems, and construct Lebesgue measure in R{{< sup "n" >}}. Other topics include L{{< sup "p" >}}spaces, Radon-Nikodym Theorem, Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem, Fubini Theorem, Hausdorff measure, and the Area and Coarea Formulas.
